# Solvent-selection
Master's project - Tailoring the descriptors used in PCA to optimise solvent mapping.

Run CLI.py file to start programme and input answers in python console. 
Optimised interactive solvent maps for your chosen reaction class will appear, 
filtered according to the reaction T you are using, with CHEM21 ratings colour coded and costs displayed. 
Plots of cumulative variance and PC loadings will also be shown, along with a plot showing the 
solvents known to be used in the chosen reaction class. 
The key literature used to find solvent yields for the chosen reaction class, and to find 
solvent properties important to the reaction class are referenced.
